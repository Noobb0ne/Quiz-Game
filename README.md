# Quiz-Game
This is a program for a quiz game where the user will be asked 5 questions about a topic.
To improve on the Basic Code I created three types of quizzes SQL, Python and Riddles.
Now the user can select what type of quiz they want to attempt and play them.
Next step would be to add a question bank and ask any five random question from them.
